          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Lack of Healthcare and those who are in Poverty.</h2>
          <p>The data here shows, for the most part, that there is a positive correlation between those who are in poverty
            tend to lack healthcare. As you begin to follow the poverty axis, most of those states
          are seeing an increase in a lack of healthcare.</p>

          <p>When viewing this data, it is important to keep in mind a few important points. There will be outliers within 
            the data that will skew the data in either direction. Those states which have a higher percentage of wealthly
            families will tend to show their state is doing well when in fact, most average citizens do not have healthcare. 
            Population must also be considered as those states that have a low population are responsible for fewer citizens 
            when it comes to providing healthcare.
          </p>

          <p>The conclusion that can be taken from this data is that, states with higher poverty tend to have a higher
            percentage of citizens lacking healthcare. When viewing this data one must also consider outliers which may skew
            this data such as states with high populations as well as those states which have higher new worth individuals.</p>
